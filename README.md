# FEEL-GOOD-FUND-Budgeting-System-Prototype
Prototype for my Computer Science - Software Principles Module Assessment


Program Coded using Python, SQLite3, and TKinter for the GUI.

Because I wanted to do this quickly for a prototype, the GUI is spaced using pixels. This means that it appears different on different displays as the pixel distance is different on different displays. It may look weird on your display. TKinter can also use tables, which produce a more consistent spacing, but it's also more complicated to do so I didn't do that.

TKinter also uses system widgets (e.g. Buttons, Entry Fields, Radio Buttons, Scrollbars, etc.).
I also coded this on macOS, so for me it uses the macOS widgets.
On Windows, the system widgets tend to be larger and blockier, so this would also mess with the layout of the program.


All of these issues are fixable if given time, as Try Except statements are incredibly useful.

An example of using Try Except statements efficiently is how this program can run in both Python2 and Python3. At the start of the program, the imported modules are different for each version of Python. To get around this, the program Tries to import the Python3 modules, but if running in Python2, the program will fail, and then Try importing the Python2 modules in the Except statement.
Big brain.

Python2 is no longer updated but some people still use it for some reason so I like to try make my programs run in both versions.



### Complete Prototype, lots of random methods that aren't used, this will be fixed at some point... or maybe never. Depends how I'm feeling.
